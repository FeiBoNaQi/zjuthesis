  abstract  = {The evolution of ubiquitous sensing technologies has led to intelligent environments that can monitor and react to our daily activities, such as adapting our heating and cooling systems, responding to our gestures, and monitoring our elderly. In this paper, we ask whether it is possible for smart environments to monitor our vital signs remotely, without instrumenting our bodies. We introduce Vital-Radio, a wireless sensing technology that monitors breathing and heart rate without body contact. Vital-Radio exploits the fact that wireless signals are affected by motion in the environment, including chest movements due to inhaling and exhaling and skin vibrations due to heartbeats. We describe the operation of Vital-Radio and demonstrate through a user study that it can track users' breathing and heart rates with a median accuracy of 99\%, even when users are 8~meters away from the device, or in a different room. Furthermore, it can monitor the vital signs of multiple people simultaneously. We envision that Vital-Radio can enable smart homes that monitor people's vital signs without body instrumentation, and actively contribute to their inhabitants' well-being.},

  abstract  = {This paper introduces WiTrack, a system that tracks the 3D motion of a user from the radio signals reflected off her body. It works even if the person is occluded from the WiTrack device or in a different room. WiTrack does not require the user to carry any wireless device, yet its accuracy exceeds current RF localization systems, which require the user to hold a transceiver. Empirical measurements with a WiTrack prototype show that, on average, it localizes the center of a human body to within a median of 10 to 13 cm in the x and y dimensions, and 21 cm in the z dimension. It also provides coarse tracking of body parts, identifying the direction of a pointing hand with a median of 11.2°. WiTrack bridges a gap between RF-based localization systems which locate a user through walls and occlusions, and human-computer interaction systems like Kinect, which can track a user without instrumenting her body, but require the user to stay within the direct line of sight of the device.},

  abstract  = {We have recently witnessed the emergence of RF-based indoor localization systems that can track user motion without requiring the user to hold or wear any device. These systems can localize a user and track his gestures by relying solely on the reflections of wireless signals off his body, and work even if the user is behind a wall or obstruction. However, in order for these systems to become practical, they need to address two main challenges: 1) They need to be able to operate in the presence of more than one user in the environment, and 2) they must be able to localize a user without requiring him to move or change his position.This paper presents WiTrack2.0, a multi-person localization system that operates in multipath-rich indoor environments and pinpoints users' locations based purely on the reflections of wireless signals off their bodies. WiTrack2.0 can even localize static users, and does so by sensing the minute movements due to their breathing. We built a prototype of WiTrack2.0 and evaluated it in a standard office building. Our results show that it can localize up to five people simultaneously with a median accuracy of 11.7 cm in each of the x/y dimensions. Furthermore, WiTrack2.0 provides coarse tracking of body parts, identifying the direction of a pointing hand with a median error of 12.5°, for multiple users in the environment.},

  abstract   = {Nowadays, an increasing amount of attention is being devoted towards passive and non-intrusive sensing methods. The prime example is healthcare applications, where on-body sensors are not always an option or in other applications which require the detection and tracking of unauthorized (non-cooperative) targets within a given environment. Therefore, in this paper we present a dataset consisting of measurements obtained from Radio-Frequency (RF) devices. Essentially, the dataset consists of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) data in the form of Channel Impulse Response (CIR), acquired via a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) UWB equipment. Approximately 1.6 hours of annotated measurements are provided, which are collected in a residential environment. This dataset can be used to passively track a target’s location in an indoor environment. Additionally, it can also be used to advance UWB-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) since three basic human activities were recorded, namely, sitting, standing and walking. We anticipate that such datasets may be utilized to develop novel algorithms and methodologies for healthcare, smart homes and security applications.},

In the network formed by these devices, communicating modules often estimate the channel impulse response to employ a matched filter to decode transmitted data or to accurately time stamp incoming messages when estimating the time-of-flight for localization. This paper investigates how such measurements of the channel impulse response can be utilized to augment existing ultra-wideband communication and localization networks to a multi-static radar network. The approach is experimentally evaluated using off-the-shelf hardware and simple, distributed filtering, and shows that a tag-free human walking in the space equipped with ultra-wideband modules can be tracked in real time. This opens the door for various location-based smart home applications, ranging from smart audio and light systems to elderly monitoring and security systems.},

The DFL system employs ultra-wideband (UWB) channel impulse response (CIR) measurements, enabling the extraction of several multipath components (MPCs) and thereby benefits from multipath propagation. We propose a radio propagation model that calculates the effect on the received signal based on the position of a person within a target area. Additionally, we propose a validated error model for the measurements and explain the creation of different feature vectors and extraction of the MPCs from Decawave DW1000 CIR measurements. We evaluate the system via simulations of the position error probability and a measurement setup in an indoor scenario. We compare the performance of MAMPI to a conventional DFL system based on four sensor nodes that measures radio signal strength values. The combination of the magnitude and phase differences for the feature vectors results in a position error probability that is comparable to a conventional system but requires only two sensor nodes.},

  abstract  = {Monitoring breathing rates and patterns helps in the diagnosis and potential avoidance of various health problems. Current solutions for respiratory monitoring, however, are usually invasive and/or limited to medical facilities. In this paper, we propose a novel respiratory monitoring system, UbiBreathe, based on ubiquitous off-the-shelf WiFi-enabled devices. Our experiments show that the received signal strength (RSS) at a WiFi-enabled device held on a person's chest is affected by the breathing process. This effect extends to scenarios when the person is situated on the line-of-sight (LOS) between the access point and the device, even without holding it. UbiBreathe leverages these changes in the WiFi RSS patterns to enable ubiquitous non-invasive respiratory rate estimation, as well as apnea detection.We propose the full architecture and design for UbiBreathe, incorporating various modules that help reliably extract the hidden breathing signal from a noisy WiFi RSS. The system handles various challenges such as noise elimination, interfering humans, sudden user movements, as well as detecting abnormal breathing situations. Our implementation of UbiBreathe using off-the-shelf devices in a wide range of environmental conditions shows that it can estimate different breathing rates with less than 1 breaths per minute (bpm) error. In addition, UbiBreathe can detect apnea with more than 96\% accuracy in both the device-on-chest and hands-free scenarios. This highlights its suitability for a new class of anywhere respiratory monitoring.},

However, existing WiFi-based human activity recognition systems do not build models that can quantify the correlation between WiFi signal dynamics and human activities. In this paper, we propose a Channel State Information (CSI)-based human Activity Recognition and Monitoring system (CARM). CARM is based on two theoretical models. First, we propose a CSI-speed model that quantifies the relation between CSI dynamics and human movement speeds. Second, we propose a CSI-activity model that quantifies the relation between human movement speeds and human activities. Based on these two models, we implemented the CARM on commercial WiFi devices. Our experimental results show that the CARM achieves recognition accuracy of 96\% and is robust to environmental changes.},
