  abstract  = {This paper introduces WiTrack, a system that tracks the 3D motion of a user from the radio signals reflected off her body. It works even if the person is occluded from the WiTrack device or in a different room. WiTrack does not require the user to carry any wireless device, yet its accuracy exceeds current RF localization systems, which require the user to hold a transceiver. Empirical measurements with a WiTrack prototype show that, on average, it localizes the center of a human body to within a median of 10 to 13 cm in the x and y dimensions, and 21 cm in the z dimension. It also provides coarse tracking of body parts, identifying the direction of a pointing hand with a median of 11.2°. WiTrack bridges a gap between RF-based localization systems which locate a user through walls and occlusions, and human-computer interaction systems like Kinect, which can track a user without instrumenting her body, but require the user to stay within the direct line of sight of the device.},

  abstract       = {A growing number of devices, from car key fobs to mobile phones to WiFi-routers, are equipped with ultra-wideband radios. In the network formed by these devices, communicating modules often estimate the channel impulse response to employ a matched filter to decode transmitted data or to accurately time stamp incoming messages when estimating the time-of-flight for localization. This paper investigates how such measurements of the channel impulse response can be utilized to augment existing ultra-wideband communication and localization networks to a multi-static radar network. The approach is experimentally evaluated using off-the-shelf hardware and simple, distributed filtering, and shows that a tag-free human walking in the space equipped with ultra-wideband modules can be tracked in real time. This opens the door for various location-based smart home applications, ranging from smart audio and light systems to elderly monitoring and security systems.},

  abstract       = {In this paper, we propose a multipath-assisted device-free localization (DFL) system that includes magnitude and phase information (MAMPI). The DFL system employs ultra-wideband (UWB) channel impulse response (CIR) measurements, enabling the extraction of several multipath components (MPCs) and thereby benefits from multipath propagation. We propose a radio propagation model that calculates the effect on the received signal based on the position of a person within a target area. Additionally, we propose a validated error model for the measurements and explain the creation of different feature vectors and extraction of the MPCs from Decawave DW1000 CIR measurements. We evaluate the system via simulations of the position error probability and a measurement setup in an indoor scenario. We compare the performance of MAMPI to a conventional DFL system based on four sensor nodes that measures radio signal strength values. The combination of the magnitude and phase differences for the feature vectors results in a position error probability that is comparable to a conventional system but requires only two sensor nodes.},
